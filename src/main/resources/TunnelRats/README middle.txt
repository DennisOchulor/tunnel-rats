Since the middle of the tunnel is not randomly generated, it has to be built and then saved into a WorldEdit schematic file.

Important things to note:
- The width and height of the middle must be the same as the tunnel's width and height.
- For 4 teams mode, the length of the middle must also be the same as its width.
- The same middle can be reused for different tunnels provided the width and height match.
- Middles are saved as .schem files. You can see them in the "plugins/WorldEdit/schematics/" folder.

Steps to create a middle:
1. Build your middle according to the required width/height of the tunnel.
2. Using WorldEdit's wand (//wand), select the entire build.
3. Type the command "/savemiddle <name>". Replace name with your preferred name. This command will teleport you to the correct position and automatically copy and save the build.
4. That's it!
